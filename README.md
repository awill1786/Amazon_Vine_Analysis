# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this analysis I will use PySpark to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in the Music dataset.
